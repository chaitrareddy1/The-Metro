This is NOT an ANDROID applicaton.

This is a simple java program that will take information from the user(source station) and the destination of Delhi metro.This application displays the fare and the shortest path to reach destination.It is also having a metro map for commuter's better navigation.
It is implemented using graph,heap data structures.Where the stations are refered to nodes and the edges is the path between the stations.Nodes contains information regarding station like station name,its metro corridor.where edge cost is the distance between its two connecting edges.
By using different algorithms like Dijkstra,Breadth-First search,Depth-First search etc the shortest path between source and destination station is calculated, and the fare is being calculated accordingly.Finally the metro route between two stations and the fare is displayed.
Main.java contains main code and heap.java contains heap implementation.
